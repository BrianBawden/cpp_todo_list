# ToDo Overview

I wanted to write a simple to do project to practice C++ as I was starting to learn the language. In the program I used: while loops, for loops, struct, and vector to make the program work. 

The program uses a while loop to get input from the user which determines which function is run to create a new task, view the tasks, complete the task or exit the to do list program. 

I wanted to practice C++ because I know it is a very widely used language and a to do list is a simple way to get some experience with the language. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
